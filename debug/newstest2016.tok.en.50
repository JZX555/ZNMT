Obama receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly .
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and about Teheran &apos;s destabilising activities in the Middle East .
The meeting was also planned to cover the conflict with the Palestinians and the disputed two state solution .
Relations between Obama and Netanyahu have been strained for years .
Washington criticises the continuous building of settlements in Israel and accuses Netanyahu of a lack of initiative in the peace process .
The relationship between the two has further deteriorated because of the deal that Obama negotiated on Iran &apos;s atomic programme , .
In March , at the invitation of the Republicans , Netanyahu made a controversial speech to the US Congress , which was partly seen as an affront to Obama .
The speech had not been agreed with Obama , who had rejected a meeting with reference to the election that was at that time impending in Israel .
In 911 Call , Professor Admits to Shooting Girlfriend
In a 911 call , his voice only slightly shaky , college professor Shannon Lamb told police he had shot his girlfriend and officers needed to get over to their house .
Lamb made a point to say his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was there alive and probably upset , and said the dead woman &apos;s family contacts could be found on her phone .
Inside the home , officers found Amy Prentiss &apos; body and a hand-written note scribbled on a white legal pad : &quot; I am so very sorry I wish I could take it back I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me , &quot; read the letter authorities say was signed by Lamb .
There was no indication that Lamb , who was teaching two online classes for Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school &apos;s campus , where police believe he shot and killed a well-liked history professor , Ethan Schmidt , in the doorway to his office .
Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said university officials heard about the shooting at 10 : 18 a.m.
He said Lamb made the fateful 911 call sometime after that .
By the end of the day , there would be one more death : Lamb took his own life as police closed in on him .
A day after the school shooting forced students and faculty to hide behind locked doors , authorities were still trying to piece together what motivated Lamb .
The details released by investigators at both ends of the state as well as students and staff who knew him helped paint a picture of a talented but possibly troubled teacher .
Students said they looked forward to his class .
Police in Gautier , where Prentiss died , said he had no history of violence or criminal record .
Schmidt himself had included Lamb in a book he wrote where he acknowledged the &quot; wonderful people &quot; he shared his academic life with .
Both taught in the Division of Social Sciences and History , which lists 17 faculty members , and many students took courses from both .
At the same time , there were some inclinations of problems .
A student who praised Lamb , Brandon Beavers , said he also seemed agitated and jittery , &quot; like there was something wrong with him . &quot;
Another student , Mikel Sykes , said Lamb told him he was dealing with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year .
Lamb had earlier asked Delta State University for a medical leave of absence , saying he had a health issue of some sort .
This year , he was only teaching two online classes .
Recent changes in the university &apos;s hiring policies meant that the doctorate Lamb had worked so hard to earn would not guarantee him an automatic tenure track to become an assistant professor .
University President William LaForge said he didn &apos;t know of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt but &quot; obviously there was something in Mr. Lamb &apos;s mind . &quot;
Those are questions Lamb can no longer answer .
After fleeing the campus , police later picked up Lamb &apos;s trail when he crossed back into Mississippi from Arkansas .
Before he could be apprehended , Lamb killed himself with a single .38-caliber pistol in the backyard of a home about a mile south of his parents &apos; home on the outskirts of Greenville , Mississippi , said Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson .
His car was still running in the driveway .
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to that home , though Johnson said she believes he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
Lamb started working at the university , which has 3,500 students in a city of about 12,000 , in 2009 and taught geography and education classes .
He received a doctorate in education in the spring .
One of Lamb &apos;s longtime friends described him as smart , charismatic and funny .
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends .
She and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried for several years to teach her to play guitar .
He was quite the heartthrob back then .
All the girls would melt when he was around , &quot; said Hairston , now 40 and living in the Jackson suburb of Brandon .
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been dating for some time .
In the 911 call , Lamb said &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no record of them ever marrying .
They had a dog named Lightning that lived with them at the brick house that backs up to a bayou in Gautier .
Police said the dog was OK .
Prentiss &apos; ex-husband , Shawn O &apos;Steen , said they divorced 15 years ago but remained friends and had a daughter who &apos;s now 19 .
&quot; She was completely devastated , &quot; O &apos;Steen said of his daughter .
She and her mother were absolutely best friends .
